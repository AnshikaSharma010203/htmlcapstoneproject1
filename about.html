I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilized React for building interactive front-end components. In terms of server-side programming, I worked with Node.js/Express.js. Additionally, I gained experience in using databases like Firebase and PostgreSQL, along with deploying applications. Overall, I'm skilled in building dynamic and responsive web applications end-to-end.   </b></i></p>
